= Contributing to Telegram Bot Java API

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Feedback is highly appreciated and pull requests are appreciated even more.

I know this library does not contain all domain objects and not all API methods, but it fits for the needs of my Telegram bots. 

So please feel free to ask for enhancements or offer pull requeusts for missing features.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
